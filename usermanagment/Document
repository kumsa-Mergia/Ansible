# Before Runing the Playbook you havve to

Ensure the sudoers file on the target hosts is correctly configured to allow the Ansible user to execute commands with sudo without a password (if that is your requirement). You can modify the sudoers file with:

    # Use visudo to edit

sudo visudo

Add a line like:

	#ansible_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
Replace ansible_user with the username that Ansible uses to connect

	#To see all tags in the playbook
ansible-playbook usermgmnt.yaml --list-tags

	# Run The playbook To Add New Group In That Server
ansible-playbook -i inventory usermgmnt.yaml --tags add_new_group
	
	# Run The playbook To Add New Group In That Server
ansible-playbook -i inventory usermgmnt.yaml --tags add_new_user
